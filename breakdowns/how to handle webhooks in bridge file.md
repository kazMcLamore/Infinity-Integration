- for each comment or item we receive we'll need to match it to something within the existing database for it to be 'findable' by a user.
- How do we want to relate...
	- Comments?
		- to an event record, 
		- to a client record, 
		- to a salesperson
	- Tasks
		- to an event
		- to a client
		- to a salesperson
- How do we determine...
	- client id
		- use parent or item id to find an opportunity record. this will have the client id.
		- save the $opportunity_id
	- event id
		- use $opportunity_id to find an event with this opportunity id.
	- salesperson
		- can be saved from either the opportunity record or the event record. 
- Do we do this all the time? Or only on create
	- all the time, these values can change at any time on either side i think.
