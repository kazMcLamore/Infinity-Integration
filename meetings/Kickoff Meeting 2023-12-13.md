# Goals of Integration
- modernize task management
	- ability to view tasks in different ways, on different devices, and for different projects.
	- leave comments
	- upload files
	- include links
- keep task management steady as we transition to new FM system
	- users infinity workflow will not change with new FM system.
	- important to establish a good workflow now.
- maintain good reporting
	- need to ensure that we can track actions taken
- allow users to work in EITHER FM or Infinity
	- I know there are pieces to this that are currently missing.
	- i need help to build out the FM workflow

# Project Restraints
- must be able to report on activity
- must be able to continue managing tasks from FM 


# Things i need from you
- regular feedback on any tasks in your lane
	- to do this you will need to test each feature and post your results
- help me understand how and where you interact with nextactions in existing FM system
	- need to know where to put the 'push' buttons 
	- maybe eventually listen for changes automatically, let's discuss
