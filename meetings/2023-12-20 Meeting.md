- was a little confused by whether she's entering the event name, opportunity name, or person name.

Current workflow
- select or find existing prospects
- you create a contact and enter all of their information and sometimes at THIS stage you are notified of a duplicate.
- if this is a new prospect
	- you enter complete information
	- including groom, event details, etc. 
- a lot of the leads are coming in automatically through the website
	- we will address this with find duplicates

#todo 
- make user stories for:
	- pushing/pulling changes from infinity
		- appointments
		- comments
	- how to create salesperson records
		- add to infinity
		- pull to filemaker
		- enter username
		- change the salesperson attribute on a task

```json
{
	"json":"is cool!"
}
